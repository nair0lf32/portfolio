# Portfolio

My portfolio! A place you can see what I did so far Or what I am working on...
I am still working on it!

Technologies used:

- Javascript (React js)
- css ( tailwind css )

## usage (React js project scripts)

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm install` (or`npm install --legacy-peer-deps`) to get the dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start the development server. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload on changes and errors are displayed in the console
- `npm test` Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode
- `npm run build` Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm run eject` This command will remove the single build dependency from your project. (Careful usage)
- `npm run deploy` Deploys to production remote server (github pages for this one)
